# You will have to import the Discord.js module to make it works
# For security reasons you will have to run 
  npm install dotenv --save
# It will install the "dotenv" package wich will allow you to use a .env file to configure some part
# Finally you have to create the .env file and create the "token" variable and put your discord's bot token inside of it.
